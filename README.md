# Node Express projects
I did these projects by following  a tutorial by John Smilga from freecodecamp.
He explains the details well and advances the learner step-by-step.

## Node starter ( to-do list)

This is a simple TO-DO list app.
The user can create,update and delete their task items. 

## Store API

This project is an illustration of an e-commerce app, though it has no frontend yet.
The user is able to query store products using pages, limits, 
numeric filters and sorting alphabetically or by price.

## JWT-BASICS

JSON Web token basics takes you through the basic use of JWTs and authentication.
It has a security feature and we can be sure of the integrity of the data shared between two parties.
Check [jwt.io](https:jwt.io) website for more information.
